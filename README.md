#  CODE REVIEW

#### JavaScript BDD code review, 1/29/2016

#### By Chris Berry

## Description

A Form gathers input from the user about what size pizza they want, and the toppings they wish to add. JavaScript is used to run the inputs from the object to show the results after the input is submitted. Also, it is styled using _Bootstrap_ and custom _CSS_ with box model and floats.
Variable names are descriptive of what they represent, and use lower camel case.
